# A Python-based Carbon emission calculator.
This calculator will calculalate carbon emission from gas combustion. It is based on three variables gas amount(kg), gas types(Ng or LPG) and combustion efficiency.Each gas types has its corresponding emission factor value and combustion efficiency(in fraction) is considered as a known value for furnace or another heating chamber. It is a simple python based coding with related variables, conditionals and loops.
# Features
firstly, It takes gas amount.
Based on two types of Gas(Ng and LPG).
Each gas types have corresponding emission factor value.
Combustion efficiency value is in fraction value instead of percentage.
easy to calculate.
# How to Run
Install Python 3
Save the script
Run the file.
# Formula used
carbon emission=gas amount*combustion efficiency*emission factor
# Example input
gas amount(kg)=20
gas type=ng
combustion efficiency=0.9
# Example output
carbon emission(kg)=55.44
